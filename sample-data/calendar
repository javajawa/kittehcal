# Events are stored as a time and a title
# The title is removed from the outputted public calendar
# but is scanned for matching tags in the `tags` file.

# The date is in third-day format -- [year]-[month]-[day]-[slot],
# with [slot] being one or more of [M]orning, [A]fternoon, or [E]vening.
# If no slot is given, then it is assumed to span all three slots.
# If the date ends in '?', then the event is marked as moveable rather
# than busy.

# If a title is '--', then this is the start data of a
# multi-day event, with the next line containing the
# end date and the title.

# Example one: new year's at bobs, an evening event
# This should pick up the 'bob' tag in the 'tags' file.
2019-12-31-E  New Year's at Bobs

# Example two: moveable all day event
2020-01-01-?  Sleeeepp

# A longer holiday, leaving in the afternoon, coming back the next night
