# ISO 8601 says that you can define a specific day in any or an unknown year
# using either the week or month calendar in the format of:
#
#  --MM-DD  (month calendar)
#  --Www-d  (week calendar)
#
# This file extends that to it's logical extreme, allowing any field to be
# replaced with a single dash.
#
# For legibility reasons, the parse will convert all asterixes to dashes,
# so "*-01-01" is equivalent to "--01-01", or the first day of the Gregorian year.
#
# Date formats accepted are:
#
#   <YYYY>-<MM>-<DD>      -- A specific Gregorian day.
#   <YYYY>-W<ww>-<d>      -- A specific ISO Week-Calendar day.
#   <YYYY>-<MM>-w<W>-<d>  -- A given day of week in a specific week of a month
#
# After this, there are three columns:
#  - The starting time slot ([M]orning, [A]fternoon, [E]vening)
#  - The ending time slot ([M]orning, [A]fternoon, [E]vening)
#  - The event title and tags.
